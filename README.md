# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various factors using machine learning techniques.


## Overview

Heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early detection and prevention are key in reducing the impact of heart disease. This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the probability of an individual having heart disease based on their health and demographic information.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle]. It contains various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators, along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.
